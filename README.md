# Heart_Diseas-Prediction
Heart disease prediction in better prognosis is conduction of so many methods and models to measure risk of an individual getting a heart disease. Top factors are your age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure levels, history of smoking and family history. These factors are analyzed using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees and neural networks in order to give risk scores. The given two step process is conditional and heavily depend on data preprocessing, feature extraction as well as model evaluation. The use of accurate prediction models can facilitate early diagnosis and preventative actions thereby improved patient outcomes and reduction in costs to the healthcare systems.
